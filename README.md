# VR Sprint Review

## Work Completed
- converted almost all vr-egg queries to use ADM
- converted vr-egg to a gRPC service
- added vr-web Rest API that calls vr-egg gRPC service

## Work Remaining
- dealer list query (in progress, we ran into difficulty getting last invoice date)
- modify vr-web to call vr-web API instead of vr-egg API
- identify data that needs to be added to ADM to exercise all use cases supported by vr-web
- query optimization
